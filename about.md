I am Yiftach Beer, a software & algorithsm developer.

This blog is where I explain concepts that I feel could be taught better.

### More Information
I've recently finished my M.Sc at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, conducting research on deep learning and convex optimization. 

Prior to do that I was the software lead at Nyx Technologies, led a software team at unit 8200 at the IDF and was a software developer at Applied Immune Technologies (later acquired by Adicet Bio).
